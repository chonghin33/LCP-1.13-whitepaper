This white paper introduces the Language Construct Modeling (LCM) framework, a formal modular architecture that enables prompt-layered semantic control in large language models (LLMs). Built upon the Meta Prompt Layering (MPL) structure, LCM provides a recursive, interpretable, and regenerative interface for constructing layered prompt structures, enabling sustained semantic modulation and functional memory alignment across multi-layered language interactions.
