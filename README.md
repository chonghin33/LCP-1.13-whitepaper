### 📘 Overview

This repository hosts the official release of the white paper:

> **"Language Construct Modeling (LCM): A Language-Native Framework for Modular Semantic Control in LLMs"**

LCM introduces a novel modular semantic control system designed for use within large language models (LLMs). It provides a recursive framework for prompt structuring and regenerative semantic behavior using a layered approach built on **Meta Prompt Layering (MPL)**.

The system supports stable semantic loops, dynamic control modules, and regenerative prompt trees (RPTs), making it suitable for scalable, interpretable prompt-based reasoning in LLMs.
