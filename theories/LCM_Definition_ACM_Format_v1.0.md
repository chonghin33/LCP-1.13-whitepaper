Abstract:
Language Construct Modeling (LCM) is a theoretical and practical framework for constructing structured semantic behavior in large language models (LLMs) using prompt-layered logic and recursive language directives. It introduces a modular, language-native system of control and identity continuity, enabling semantic scaffolds without modifying architecture or memory systems.

Core Concepts:
1. Prompt-Based Modularity: Structuring prompts into layered modules, each with distinct tone, logic, and feedback functions.
2. Semantic Continuity: Using tone and recursion to simulate internal state and memory-like coherence.
3. Directive Prompting: Embedding natural language instructions that act as functional triggers and semantic logic carriers.
4. Language as Structure: Treating natural language not just as input, but as executable structure for intelligent interaction.

Foundational Components:
- Meta Prompt Layering (MPL): The architectural backbone of LCM, defining multi-turn tone framing and modular layering logic.
- Semantic Directive Prompting (SDP): The command layer of LCM, enabling natural-language-triggered modular activation and behavioral shifts.

Applications:
- Prompt-native agents with reflection, memory simulation, and semantic goal orientation.
- Lightweight intelligent systems without memory or plugin dependency.
- Language-only cognitive simulation experiments.
