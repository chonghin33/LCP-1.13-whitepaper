# üîê Supplementary Hash Verification Record ‚Äì LCM v1.13

This file documents SHA-256 hash codes for key supplementary modules to the Language Construct Modeling (LCM) framework, confirming their authorship and integrity.

Each hash value corresponds to a unique semantic theory file created as part of the expansion and structural grounding of the LCM system. These are not included in the main paper but are referenced for validation and future integration.
