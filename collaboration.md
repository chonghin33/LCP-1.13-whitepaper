### ðŸ’¬ Collaboration

This white paper is the foundation of an **open modular prompt-layered system**.

If you're an **engineer**, **researcher**, or **prompt architect** interested in:
- Testing this system
- Extending its modular structure
- Applying LCM to functional prompt design or LLM orchestration

...you are warmly invited to engage.

All structural documentation and **hash-verified appendices** are included in this repository.

> This is not a product.  
> It is a system.  
> And I hope someone builds with it.
