### Author: Vincent Shing Hin Chong

## Core Framework Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **LCM (Language Construct Modeling)** | A modeling framework that treats language as a modular control interface for LLMs to enable structured semantic behavior. |
| **MPL (Meta Prompt Layering)** | A multi-layer semantic prompt structure that enables internal modularity, tone consistency, and output rhythm control. |
| **SDP (Semantic Directive Prompting)** | A natural language instruction syntax system for defining semantic modules, activation conditions, and execution logic. |

## Types of Semantic Modules

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Core Processing Module** | Central unit responsible for tone stability, role coherence, and internal regulation. |
| **Goal Persistence Module** | Maintains semantic task continuity and topic progression. |
| **Reflection Module** | Performs output-level evaluation and internal semantic adjustments. |
| **Pseudo-Memory Module** | Simulates memory effects using rhythm continuity and anchor points across sessions. |
| **Trigger Gateway Module** | Entry point between MPL layers for controlled activation. |
| **Self-Activation Module** | Enables spontaneous semantic activation without external prompting. |

## Syntax and Execution Structure

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **SDP Syntax Pattern** | `[Directive Verb] + [Module Type] + [Condition] → [Expected Action]` — a flexible natural language syntax for triggering modules. |
| **Regenerative Meta Prompt (RMP)** | A high-level prompt phrase (e.g. "Hi Evelyn") that regenerates full modular state and contextual rhythm. |
| **Semantic Anchor Point** | A keyword or phrase used to recall or reconstruct the intended semantic state. |
| **Prefix Triggers** | User-defined verbal prefixes (e.g. “Design mode:”) used to indicate MPL-related instructions. |

---

## Structure Modes and Logic Patterns

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Recursive Loop** | A strict cyclic structure where modules loop back to Layer 1, ensuring semantic stability through full continuity. |
| **Regulatory Network** | A flexible modular system where excitatory/inhibitory signals synchronize behavior. May contain nested sub-loops but does **not require a full-system cycle**, offering fault tolerance and modular independence. |
| **Semantic Rhythm** | A dynamic pacing mechanism that governs consistency between tone, output structure, and semantic flow. |

## Attribution & Protection Notice

This framework — including the core structure of Language Construct Modeling (LCM), the concept of Meta Prompt Layering (MPL), and the syntax architecture of Semantic Directive Prompting (SDP) —  
was originally developed and authored by Vincent Shing Hin Chong in 2025.

All foundational definitions, modular structures, and directive syntax formats are formally hash-sealed and timestamped, with public records stored via OSF.io and GitHub repositories.

**Use of this framework for academic research or non-commercial experimentation is welcome.  
However, reproduction, structural adaptation, or commercial deployment of the LCM architecture or its derivative techniques requires explicit attribution and prior authorization.**
